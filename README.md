# Algorithms-and-Data-Structures-Practice

This repository contains practice for code challanges from websites such as [HackerRank](https://www.hackerrank.com/), [CodeCademy](https://www.codecademy.com/learn), and [LeetCode](https://leetcode.com/problemset/). The repositories that contain data structure and algorithm implementations (lineardatastructures, nonlineardatastructures, graphs, and sortingalgorithms) follow the implementations done while completing CodeCademy's course [Pass the Technical Interview with Java](https://www.codecademy.com/learn/paths/pass-the-technical-interview-with-java)
